# Angular training on Alura 🅰️
This repository gathers projects developed as part of an [extensive Angular training on Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/degree/certificate/ff908da2-e6a9-4a6b-befa-25cceb08ca41?lang=en_US).  

## Memoteca 📑
An application to be used as a wall of thoughts and quotes. Users can add, edit and remove phrases or short texts they liked. They can also mark some of those texts texts as favorites.  

Building this project, I learned how to use the **Angular CLI** and how **Angular components** work and are structured. I also learned about and used **data and event bindings**, some **Angular directives** and **routing settings**.  

## angular-forms (Sign-in form) 📝
This project is a simple sign-in form. To complete it, I used some **form validations**, such as *required*, *minLength*, *maxLength* and *pattern* using *regex*. I also created a couple of **custom validation directives** to validate zip codes and minimum ages from dates of birth.  

## angular-lifecycle (Shopping list) 📃
A simple shopping list application. Users can add, edit, remove and check items in a list.  

It uses Angular's **lifecycle hooks**, such as *OnInit*, *OnChanges*, *DoCheck* and *OnDestroy*.  

## Buscante 🔍
Buscante allows users to search books on the **Google Books API**. Users cannot add or edit books information with it.  

Data is retrieved using *observables*, then transformed by **RxJS** *operators* into proper TypeScript models to be used on Angular components.  

## Memorando 📋
Memorando is a task manager. Users can create, edit, search and delete tasks, as well as marking them as finished.  

Memorando uses Angular's **animations module** to create animations that improve users' experience by providing visual feedback on their actions and highlighting the application's flow of actions.
